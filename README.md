This was included on my fitness web application named 'FitFlex'. This calculator allowed the user to calculate their one rep maximum lift for an exercise. There was an option to save this information on the application to track their progress. The calculator allows the user to easily figure out their lifting capabilities from the weight they have lifted in pounds or kilograms, and the amount of repitions they have done. This calculator is built of a professional formula used for calculating one rep maxes.
